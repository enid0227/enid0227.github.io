This is the first time I setup a jekyll GtiHub pages. Will be sharing some projects that I've been
working on this github page.

Setup Jekyll based on the
[GitHub official doc](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
and the official setup guide from [Jekyll on mac](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

### Notes

#### Missing `webrick` dependency

fixed this by running `bundle add webrick` within the project root directory. See
[GitHub Pages Issue](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/752) for details.

## Auto-Generated-Section (Below)

**kept the auto-generated doc below for furture reference.**

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see
your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run
`jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is
the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front
matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File
all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask
them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
